# Google DSC @ SJSU Flutter Workshop

An introduction to Flutter by creating a simple portfolio app that our members can personalize. 

## Pre-Installs

We will be using the newest Flutter SDK, Dart, and an iOS iPhone 11 simulator to begin with. Make sure you have either 
the Xcode simulator or an Android simulator in advance to the workshop (those take long to download). 

We recommend having the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio installed.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


We will guide you on how to start your Flutter project and modify the initial template to produce a portfolio app.
